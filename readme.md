# GPT-Bio Sorter

Takes in the bio of a user and returns a list of related keywords that can be used in searches. Used for engines where searching for users by field/profession/interest may be necessary. By using AI, we can find synonymous search terms so that users do not have to use the exact terms in a bio, but can rather describe what someone does.

## Usage

Make a .env file and put your API key in it like so:

```
API_KEY=you_wish_i_would_put_my_api_key_here
```

Then run `node index.js`
